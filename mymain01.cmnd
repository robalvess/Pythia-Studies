! t bar production at the LHC

Beams:idA = 2212    ! first incoming beam is a 2212, i.e. a proton.
Beams:idB = 2212    ! second beam is also a proton.
Beams:eCM = 8000.   ! the cm energy of collisions.
Top:gg2ttbar = on   !switches the process g g -> t tbar on.
Top:qqbar2ttbar = on    !switch on the process q qbar -> t tbar.
